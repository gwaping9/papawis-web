Papawis Web Portal

I am a basketball enthusiast(software engineer by day) and belongs to a basketball club. A use case presented itself and here it is. 
Papawis Web is a simple site that displays basketball league information.

The site is developed using the MEAN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS) stack and Twitter Bootstrap. 

The site is hosted on Heorku and can be seen [here](http://fathomless-island-3471.herokuapp.com/#/home)

DB is hosted on [MongoLab](https://mongolab.com)
